VPinball editor
===============

Some quick notes about the targets generated by this project:

**gui** should contain anything related to the graphical user interface.

**editor** all the table edition logic outside of presentation and user input
interpretation.

**adapter** is a decoupling layer between the original VPinball code and the editor.
The goal of this layer is to allow the editor application NOT to have to include
anything related to VPinball.

To summarize: **gui** presents stuff from **editor** and respond to user input by
forwarding any command to **editor**. **editor** acts on the actual VPinball table
being edited through the **adapter** layer.
